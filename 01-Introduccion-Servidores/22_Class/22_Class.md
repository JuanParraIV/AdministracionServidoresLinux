# Procesos y Señales en Linux

### Proceso

Un proceso representa una referencia a un programa en ejecución dentro de nuestro sistema, el cual puede ser controlado y monitoreado. Utiliza recursos como memoria, E/S y capacidad de procesamiento.

### Demonio

Los demonios son procesos que se ejecutan en segundo plano, reiniciándose automáticamente bajo ciertas condiciones o ejecutándose de forma persistente. Por lo general, se inician durante el arranque del sistema.

### Señales

Las señales son eventos de bajo nivel que se utilizan en el ámbito del kernel para interrumpir otros procesos. Cada señal tiene un número y un nombre asociado. Algunas señales comunes son:

| No. | Short name | What it means |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| 1   | SIGHUP     | If a process is being run from terminal and that terminal suddenly goes away then the process receives this signal. “HUP” is short for “hang up” and refers to hanging up the telephone in the days of telephone modems. |
| 2   | SIGINT     | The process was “interrupted”. This happens when you press Control+C on the controlling terminal. |
| 3   | SIGQUIT    |                                                                             |
| 4   | SIGILL     | Illegal instruction. The program contained some machine code the CPU can't understand. |
| 5   | SIGTRAP    | This signal is used mainly from within debuggers and program tracers. |
| 6   | SIGABRT    | The program called the abort() function. This is an emergency stop. |
| 7   | SIGBUS     | An attempt was made to access memory incorrectly. This can be caused by alignment errors in memory access, etc. |
| 8   | SIGFPE     | A floating point exception happened in the program. |
| 9   | SIGKILL    | The process was explicitly killed by somebody wielding the kill program. |
| 10  | SIGUSR1    | Left for the programmers to do whatever they want. |
| 11  | SIGSEGV    | An attempt was made to access memory not allocated to the process. This is often caused by reading off the end of arrays, etc. |
| 12  | SIGUSR2    | Left for the programmers to do whatever they want. |
| 13  | SIGPIPE    | If a process is producing output that is being fed into another process that consumes it via a pipe (“producer | consumer”) and the consumer dies, then the producer is sent this signal. |
| 14  | SIGALRM    | A process can request a “wake-up call” from the operating system at some time in the future by calling the alarm() function. When that time comes round, the wake-up call consists of this signal. |
| 15  | SIGTERM    | The process was explicitly killed by somebody wielding the kill program. |
| 16  | unused     |                                                                             |
| 17  | SIGCHLD    | The process had previously created one or more child processes with the fork() function. One or more of these processes have since died. |
| 18  | SIGCONT    | (To be read in conjunction with SIGSTOP.) If a process has been paused by sending it SIGSTOP, then sending SIGCONT to the process wakes it up again (“continues” it). |
| 19  | SIGSTOP    | (To be read in conjunction with SIGCONT.) If a process is sent SIGSTOP, it is paused by the operating system. All its state is preserved ready for it to be restarted (by SIGCONT), but it doesn't get any more CPU cycles until then. |
| 20  | SIGTSTP    | Essentially the same as SIGSTOP. This is the signal sent when the user hits Control+Z on the terminal. (SIGTSTP is short for “terminal stop”) The only difference between SIGTSTP and SIGSTOP is that pausing is only the default action for SIGTSTP but is the required action for SIGSTOP. The process can opt to handle SIGTSTP differently but gets no choice regarding SIGSTOP. |
| 21  | SIGTTIN    | The operating system sends this signal to a backgrounded process when it tries to read input
| 22  | SIGTTOU    | The operating system sends this signal to a backgrounded process when it tries to write output to its terminal. The typical response is as per SIGTTIN. |
| 23  | SIGURG     | The operating system sends this signal to a process using a network connection when "urgent" out-of-band data is sent to it. |
| 24  | SIGXCPU    | The operating system sends this signal to a process that has exceeded its CPU limit. You can cancel any CPU limit with the shell command "ulimit -t unlimited" prior to running make, though it is more likely that something has gone wrong if you reach the CPU limit in make. |
| 25  | SIGXFSZ    | The operating system sends this signal to a process that has tried to create a file above the file size limit. You can cancel any file size limit with the shell command "ulimit -f unlimited" prior to running make, though it is more likely that something has gone wrong if you reach the file size limit in make. |
| 26  | SIGVTALRM  | This is very similar to SIGALRM, but while SIGALRM is sent after a certain amount of real time has passed, SIGVTALRM is sent after a certain amount of time has been spent running the process. |
| 27  | SIGPROF    | This is also very similar to SIGALRM and SIGVTALRM, but while SIGALRM is sent after a certain amount of real time has passed, SIGPROF is sent after a certain amount of time has been spent running the process and running system code on behalf of the process. |
| 28  | SIGWINCH   | (Mostly unused these days.) A process used to be sent this signal when one of its windows was resized. |
| 29  | SIGIO      | (Also known as SIGPOLL.) A process can arrange to have this signal sent to it when there is some input ready for it to process or an output channel has become ready for writing. |
| 30  | SIGPWR     | A signal sent to processes by a power management service to indicate that power has switched to a short-term emergency power supply. The process (especially long-running daemons) may care to shut down cleanly before the emergency power fails. |
| 31  | SIGSYS     | Unused. |
